    <h2>How To Craft:</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Drive to your local grocery</li>
        <li>Find the meat section</li>
        <li>Pick a steak</li>
        <li>Find nearest employee</li>
        <li>Inquire about where the steak in question is sourced</li>
        <li>Drive to said location</li>
        <li>Observe said cows</li>
        <li>Now that you know what you're up against, make an even better steak by sourcing an even better cow</li>
        <li>Sit down and reflect. Remember the story your grandpa used to tell you</li>
        <li>"The Omniscient Odin Cow lies somewhere not to the East but by West and Forged into Metallic Skies"</li>
        <li>This has always confused you, but you're older now. You know exactly where to find this cow</li>
        <li>Get up and head to Ikea</li>
        <li>Sneak your way into the basement, level 40</li>
        <li>There, cow waits</li>
        <li>Take cow and head home, don't worry about Ikea, they never noticed</li>
        <li>Begin to prepare cow for steak making</li>
        <li>Google how to continue from here, because I don't actually know, I'm just the narrator</li>
    </ol>
