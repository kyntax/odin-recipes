    <h2><em>Nothing ordinary about this egg...</em></h2>
    <h3>Premium one-of-a-kind egg sourced from the depths of The Odin Caves.
    <br>
    Plucked from the nests of Odin bats.
    <br>
    These eggs taste like nothing you've ever had before.
    </h3>
    <h2>How To Craft:</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One (1) Odin bat egg</li>
            <li>Stove, or other source of fire</li>
            <li>Two (2) plates</li>
        </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Obtain the Odin bat egg (don't have an Odin bat egg? stop immediately and choose another recipe.)</li>
        <li>Crack the Odin bat egg</li>
        <li>Put a plate over fire</li>
        <li>Plop egg onto plate</li>
        <li>Allow egg to simmer for 19 minutes</li>
        <li>Once it's been 19 minutes and you've absolutely seared the plate, there should be a strong smell</li>
        <li>That smell means done-zo</li>
        <li>Turn off the fire, place delicately cooked egg onto a fresh plate, throw old plate away because you ruined it</li>
        <li><em>Voila</em>, serve warm and enjoy</li>
    </ol>
